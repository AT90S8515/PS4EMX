PS4EMX - The first ever Playstation 4 emulation/virtualization project!

PS4EMX is a project to create a PS4 emulator/virtual machine that can run on Windows, and any other OSes. Some of the features that will likely be implemented in the future:

1.Supports emulation mode (which emulates the entire x86-64/AMD64 processor and memory, hardware, interrupts, etc., including relevant PS4 hardware), and hopefully one-day full virtualization mode (which will also use some emulation, but will be like VirtualBox for the most part).

2.Ability to map emulated memory to secondary-storage, so computers will little RAM can still replicate PS4 RAM in emulation mode.

3.Dynamic recompiler for PS4 shader code to native shader code on the target GPU.

4.A.O.T. compilation for I.L., which is the ability to compile a PS4 game to an almost exact native binary (with some intermediate code) for the target OS, with little software compatibility layers needed to support some code peculiarities.

5.Run Orbis OS and PS4 games alongside Windows and other OSes (some day)!
