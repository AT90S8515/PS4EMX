PS4EMX
======

PS4EMX - The first ever Playstation 4 Emulator project!

PS4EMX is a conceptual design to create a PS4 emulator/virtual machine that runs with a combination of OpenGL/OpenCL
shader recompilers, a hypervisor and core based on optimized Bochs and Virtual Box, and OpenAL Soft for sound. It will also take advantage of Mantle, low-level ARB shading, and will be very hardware specific, and will use no plugins.
