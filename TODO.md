1. Emulate a display (DirectX, OpenGL, Mantle (maybe)
1. Emulate sound (DirectSound, XAudio, Mantle (maybe)
1. Emulate Blu-Ray drive (also implement using ISO images, or the loading of other file types)
1. Implement common emulation/virtualization features (save states, recording, rapid fire, custom controls, etc.)
1. Implement a debugger, disassembler, memory editor, etc. (to make reversing easier through the emulator)
1. Implement extra nice to have features (higher resolutions, frame rate cap removal, NTSC/PAL conversion, english translations, aspect ratio patching, etc.)

*NOTE: These will require more research.


All of these things are subject to change, however in general they can be implemented as well as anything.


The only really difficult thing I can think of is rewind. For people who don't know, rewind is basically being able to emulate a console backwards as well as forwards. In other words, it's twice as much work for the hardware you are running, and often times makes things break, crash, freeze, or cause other problems. There are very few emulators which have this feature for this reason.

However, a programmer created a reverse emulation library, and it seems to work fine enough that multiple Android emulators use it, but mostly it is used to emulate very old systems and it is very buggy. But who knows, maybe because it is PC like it will be easier than we think. We will have to see.
